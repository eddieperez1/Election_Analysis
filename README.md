## Overview of Election Analysis

Seth and Tom receive the election audit for candidates but they also want the election audit for county voter turnout. The purpose of this challenge is to code in python the election results for county voter turnout. During the modules, the code for election results for candidates was completed. The election audit explores the voting results for candidates and counties and analyzes which candidate won.

## Election Audit Results
The results of the election audit were written to election_analysis.txt.

## Election Audti Summary

A business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election is to use the skeleton structure of the code for varying election data. For example since the skeleton structure opens a csv file, loops through each row and then writes to election results, the csv file can have voting data for multiple candidates like president, senator, and treasurer. In the skeleton code, other data can be tracked and analyzed similarly to candidate and county election results in the election audit. Also, it is possible to drill down and find out which candidate won in each county instead of finding the candidate that won by total votes.
